# Implementation of character level cnn using keras.

<p> This the implementation of the character level cnn for text classification on AG's news dataset. <p>

<p> This is actually based on the [Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5782-character-level-convolutional-networks-for-text-classification.pdf) by xiang xhang. <p>

### Prerequisites

- Keras
- Tensorflow
- python3

### Usage

1. Install keras and Tensorflow
2. Run the main.py as follows.
   
   - python main.py
